Ecofind is an innovative new application designed to facilitate guilt-free 3D-printing. This idea is particularly relevant in our current time due to the lack of effective methods for disposing of or recycling 3D printing plastic filament. While plastics like PLA are deemed biodegradable, they can only degrade naturally in industrial composting environments. The problem arises as most composting facilities are ill-equipped to process PLA plastics, leading to their disposal in landfills. Additionally, plastics like PLA, TPU, and ABS are not easily recyclable and require a significant amount of processing power, which many recycling facilities are unable to provide. Consequently, they too end up in landfills. Our solution to this problem is to create an application that connects 3D printing enthusiasts with those capable of recycling and appropriately processing these types of plastics. This approach aims to prevent easily reusable plastics from clogging our landfills.
